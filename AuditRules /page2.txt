Note
Researchers can assume the price reported by the collateral to the alchemist is accurate and not subject to manipulation.
The only in-scope behavior related to the price is that it can be assumed that pricing is based on fundamental oracles - ie, a yield token with 1 eth of backing but a market price of 0.95 eth would be priced as 1 eth in the Alchemist.
The fact that the alAsset could temporarily depeg down to the market price of the yield token is know and acceptable behavior.
Any other scenario that would result in bad debt for the alchemist due to an exploit would be in-scope
Build Instructions
Tests need a forked environment (local node or RPC API key) due to integrations with other platforms.

Please note that we recommend consistently running off of the same block to get caching, the block given is the one we usually use:

 forge test --fork-url <RPC-URL> --fork-block-number 21835200
Basic POC Test
The mandatory POC rule applies for this competition.
